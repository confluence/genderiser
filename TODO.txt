TODO

* basic pronouns
* customizable gender options
* customizable additional global gendered words
* customizable per-character gendered words, like first names; should be extendable to random other things, like last names
* variable behaviour for keys which are not found: fallback to key or obvious error
* optional verbose output reporting what substitutions are to be made, what files are processed, etc..
* where does config live? Run it from current dir for now? Python package ASAP?
* write tests
* option of only outputting a dictionary of substitutions in various formats, to allow later integration with other tools
* later: custom variable regex?
