TODO

* add basic command-line API
* files: specify individual files; can use globbing outside
* make this into a proper package with a directory the default config lives in and stuff

* make all commandline options permanently configurable in the file?

* optional verbose output reporting what substitutions are to be made, what files are processed, etc..
* option of only outputting a dictionary of substitutions in various formats, to allow later integration with other tools
* for the same reason, and for ease of testing, option to read config from text
* option of inheritance for other genders, so that all sets of gender-neutral pronouns can use the same gender-neutral words
* put word definitions in a config.d directory
