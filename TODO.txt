TODO

* put default config straight in the py file so it can be a standalone script. Maybe use a string and a StringIO? readfp?
* forget global config files for now; default is not going to change and people can override anything in the project config anyway.

* how do we pass a multiline string to the program?
* optional verbose output reporting what substitutions are to be made, what files are processed, etc..

* option of inheritance for other genders, so that all sets of gender-neutral pronouns can use the same gender-neutral words

* Possibility for Word documents: https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx
* Also want: odt

* python 3 compatibility
* packaging later
* GUI later
