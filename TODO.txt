* capitalisation! Capitalise initial letter for first letter capitalisation.
* optional verbose output reporting what substitutions are to be made, what files are processed, etc..
* where does config live? Run it from current dir for now? Python package ASAP?
* option of only outputting a dictionary of substitutions in various formats, to allow later integration with other tools
* make paths OS-agnostic
