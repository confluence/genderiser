   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Genderiser Documentation
========================

Genderiser is a program which assists writers in making the genders of characters within large bodies of English-language text dynamically configurable. It is a standalone Python script which should run on any operating system with a recent version of Python 2 installed.

The program currently only has a command-line interface, but I will eventually be adding a GUI to make it more accessible to non-technical users.

Testers are welcome! Please file bugs and feature requests on the `project homepage <https://bitbucket.org/confluence/genderiser>`_.
