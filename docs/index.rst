Genderiser Documentation
========================

Genderiser is a program which makes it easier for writers to switch the genders of characters within large bodies of English-language text.

Writers can use placeholder variables instead of pronouns and other gendered words within the source text. Genderiser processes these documents and generates copies in which the variables have been replaced by the appropriate English words. The gender of each character is set in a simple configuration file.

The program is a standalone Python script which should run on any operating system with a recent version of Python 2 installed.

The program currently only has a command-line interface, but I will eventually be adding a GUI to make it more accessible to non-technical users.

Testers are welcome! Please file bugs and feature requests on the `project homepage <https://bitbucket.org/confluence/genderiser>`_.
